# Contributing to SLMN.GG

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to SLMN.GG. Contributions you make will be reviewed and may make its way to [SLMN.GG](https://slmn.gg).

## Getting started

There's lots of things on SLMN.GG that can be worked on. The expansion potential on this project is huge, so there's always something to get your hands on.

A good first step is familiarising yourself with the repository. Follow the instructions in the readme to set up your development environment. At this time, the SLMN.GG data is not public but a copy of the structure can be delivered upon request.

You can check out the [quick](https://github.com/slmnio/slmngg-sfc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aquick) or [good first issue](https://github.com/slmnio/slmngg-sfc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) filters in Issues to find a good starting point.

## Adding your changes

When you're working on a feature, you should follow these steps:

- Fork and branch. It's good practice to never commit to master, even on your own fork, so any other changes can be made independently. 
- Commit little and often. Once you've got something working, commit it so we can see the progress. Tools like JetBrain's internal git diffs are great at selecting small bits of code for individual commits.
- Create a pull request once you've pushed your first commit. This helps to keep track of your work, and I can add my own contributions or request changes.
- Make your PR detailed with screenshots of your changes.

## Specific restrictions on this repository

This project is being used as my final year project at university. As such, there's restrictions on what I can accept from other people.

In general, contributions can be accepted as long as I can work with you and help to direct the changes. This way, I'm working alongside developers and leading a team through updates. You should expect some decent engagement on PRs that will need your responses and changes before I can officially accept it.

You should also make sure that if you're working on multiple changes at once, that your PRs are fully independent (if it makes sense to be). Most changes can be isolated even if you're running with different code on your local machine. As an example, if a change you need is to edit the data server to work with your domains, that can be a separate request to an overlay you're building. The code for each individual change shouldn't be on each other's PRs.
